## Tutorials

### Great if you're new to programming
  * **Treehouse's iOS & Swift track**
  [https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/beginner-ios-development](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/beginner-ios-development)

  Not free, but a great collection of tutorials that mix videos, pop quizzes and practical learning. Free trial available.

  * **Learn to Code iOS Apps with Swift Tutorial 1: Welcome to Programming**
  [https://www.raywenderlich.com/143771/swift-tutorial-part-1-expressions-variables-constants](https://www.raywenderlich.com/143771/swift-tutorial-part-1-expressions-variables-constants)

  Try this tutorial from Ray Wenderlich. It's free, doesn’t assume any prior knowledge of programming, and will help teach you the fundamentals alongside learning Swift and iOS.

  * **Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift)**
    [https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html)
    The official Swift & iOS resource from Apple, this is a tutorial which offers guided introduction to building your first app.

### Great if you already have some programming experience
  * **Developing iOS 1 - Apps with Swift by Stanford University**
  [https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-10-apps-with-swift/id1198467120](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-10-apps-with-swift/id1198467120)

  Hands down (in my opinion) the best Swift & iOS course out there - people at Stanford uni pay a lot of money for this course, and you can get it completely free on iTunes U.  With the release of the iOS 10 version — it's bang-up-to-date. The only catch is that it does assume prior programming knowledge of another object-oriented language, so if you're new to programming, I'd start with Treehouse.

  * **Getting Started with TDD in Swift 3**

  This tutorial will help you write your first TDD app in Swift by building a FizzBuzz game for iOS. We’ll build it up step-by-step with fun challenges along the way and learn about different aspects of building a mobile app.

  *Full disclosure - I wrote this one.*
